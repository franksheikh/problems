# Solutions that require sequences of elements to meet criteria often utilize prefix sums,

# Sequence of odd numbers where the amount is equal to k

# If a problem asks for the: 
	# Number of subarrays
	# Finding subarrays that meet a certain sum or count condition) (like having 
    # a specific sum, product, or a certain number of odd/even elements), itâ€™s a good hint that the prefix sum approach could be useful.
